Solving 8-Queens Problem by Generating Permutations


The well-known 8-Queens Problem is to place 8 queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that no queen attacks any other queen. It is equivalent to the condition that on the row, column and the two diagonals of a queen’s square, there can be no other queen.
